# Eye-disease-detection


Numerous eye conditions, including trachoma, corneal ulcers, and cataracts, among others, can impair vision. According to studies, early-stage disorders that go untreated are the main causes of blindness in India. The advancement of these eye diseases can only be stopped if they are appropriately diagnosed at an early stage. These eye diseases have a wide range of visually discernible symptoms.Utilizing digital image processing methods like segmentation and morphology as well as deep learning methods like convolution neural network, we proposeal unique method to give an automated eye disease identification model using visually observable symptoms. 

Methodologies:

      Here we use ResNet (Residual Networks) which is a CNN architecture have been widely used in Medical image Analysis

      Their skip-connections help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and allow for the training of very deep networks.


Detect ocular diseases at their earliest stages, allowing for timely intervention and treatment to prevent vision loss or complications.
